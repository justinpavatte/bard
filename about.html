    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Justin Pavatte and I'm a computer programmer.</p>
    <p>I've been programming since the early 90s when I programmed my TI-82 to do my Algebra for me in 8th grade.</p>
    <p>I enjoy working with cross platform and Windows technologies. I'm currently interested in make some simple mobile web apps.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, I like spending time with my wonderful wife and our son.</p>
